Flu may require antiviral medication (Tamiflu) if started early. Get a flu shot annually for prevention.",

Migraines are often characterized by severe, throbbing pain, usually on one side of the head, accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light/sound. Tension headaches are typically a dull, aching pain, like a tight band around the head. **Treatment & Solution:** Managing risk factors involves regular medical check-ups, maintaining a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise), and avoiding known triggers.

      "answer": "The risk factors for what are the early signs of parkinson's disease often include genetics, age, and lifestyle choices. Early signs include tremor (shaking) at rest, slowness of movement (bradykinesia), rigidity (stiffness), and impaired balance. Symptoms usually begin subtly and worsen over time. **Treatment & Solution:** Managing risk factors involves regular medical check-ups, maintaining a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise), and avoiding known triggers.

      "answer": "Treatment for hydrocephalus is highly individualized and depends on the severity and specific symptoms. Hydrocephalus is the buildup of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, which can put pressure on brain tissue. It can be congenital or acquired due to injury, stroke, or infection. **Treatment & Solution:** Consult a specialist (neurologist, psychiatrist, etc.) for an accurate diagnosis. Treatment often involves a combination of medication, therapy (physical, occupational, or speech), and lifestyle modifications. Early intervention generally leads to better outcomes.",

      "answer": "Treatment for the long-term impact of concussions is highly individualized and depends on the severity and specific symptoms. While most concussions resolve fully, repeated concussions or severe single concussions can lead to long-term issues like post-concussion syndrome (persistent headaches, dizziness), or, rarely, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). **Treatment & Solution:** Consult a specialist (neurologist, psychiatrist, etc.) for an accurate diagnosis. Treatment often involves a combination of medication, therapy (physical, occupational, or speech), and lifestyle modifications. Early intervention generally leads to better outcomes.",
