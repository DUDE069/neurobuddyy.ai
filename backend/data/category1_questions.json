For kidney stones: pain management, hydration, most pass naturally, strain urine to catch stone, sometimes procedures needed. For muscle strain: rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medication, gentle stretching. For digestive issues: treat underlying condition, dietary modifications. Never ignore sudden severe abdominal pain - always needs medical evaluation. Location, severity, and associated symptoms guide urgency. Cannot self-diagnose abdominal pain - too many possibilities.

      "answer": "Bilateral foot numbness indicates diabetes (diabetic neuropathy - most common), vitamin B12 deficiency, alcohol abuse, spinal stenosis, peripheral artery disease, or nerve damage. Symmetrical numbness suggests systemic cause. **Treatment & Solution:** See doctor for diagnosis (blood tests check diabetes, vitamin levels; nerve studies assess nerve function). For diabetes: strict blood sugar control (prevents worsening), foot care crucial (daily inspection, proper footwear, avoid barefoot walking - can't feel injuries!), pain medications for neuropathy (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine). For B12 deficiency: supplementation (often injections initially). For spinal stenosis: physical therapy, epidural injections, sometimes surgery. General: inspect feet daily for wounds (can't rely on feeling), proper fitting shoes, avoid extreme temperatures, gentle exercise maintains circulation. Early treatment prevents complications.

Everyone makes mistakes), make amends if possible and appropriate (apologize, correct situation if can), accept what cannot be changed (radical acceptance - doesn't mean approve, means stop fighting reality), focus on present and future choices (can't change past but control current actions), consider: would you be person you are today without that experience? Challenge 'if only' thinking (counterfactual thinking impossible to know alternative timeline). For persistent regret affecting daily life: therapy helps process and release. Regret sometimes serves purpose - prevents repeating mistake - then can be let go.",

      "question": "What causes chest tightness when anxious?",
      "answer": "Anxiety chest tightness results from muscle tension, rapid breathing (hyperventilation changes blood chemistry), and increased awareness of normal heart sensations during stress response. Very common anxiety symptom - scary but not dangerous. **Treatment & Solution:** During episode: recognize it's anxiety not heart attack (though if first time or uncertain, get checked), practice slow controlled breathing (in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6 - slows heart rate), loosen tight clothing, change position, progressive muscle relaxation (tense then release muscle groups), remind yourself sensation temporary and harmless, distraction with grounding techniques. Long-term: regular exercise (reduces baseline anxiety), practice daily breathing exercises, therapy (especially CBT for anxiety), meditation and mindfulness, treat underlying anxiety disorder. Learn difference between anxiety and cardiac symptoms (cardiac worsens with exertion, anxiety during rest; cardiac radiates to arm/jaw, anxiety stays in chest). First episode warrants medical evaluation to rule out heart problems - then focus on anxiety management.",

      "question": "How do I overcome analysis paralysis?",
      "answer": "Analysis paralysis - overthinking decision prevents making any decision - results from perfectionism, fear of wrong choice, too many options, or unclear priorities. Ironically prevents progress. **Treatment & Solution:** Set decision deadline (not indefinite - forces choice), limit information gathering (more info doesn't always mean better decision), recognize 'good enough' (perfect option rarely exists), identify non-negotiables (narrows options), consider opportunity cost (not deciding IS decision with consequences), use decision-making frameworks (pros/cons list, but limit time spent - 20 minutes not 20 hours), trust gut after analysis (intuition synthesizes information), remember: most decisions reversible or adjustable, action provides information (won't know how decision feels until try), practice with small decisions (builds decisiveness muscle), perfectionism impossible (every choice has trade-offs). Remember: no decision perfect in hindsight. Make informed decision then commit. Course-correct if needed. Overthinking exhausting and unproductive.",

Build confidence: focus on own values not others' approval, practice self-compassion, acknowledge strengths and accomplishments. Behavioral: gradually expose yourself to feared situations (start small - builds tolerance), make deliberate small 'mistakes' (proves world doesn't end), surround yourself with accepting supportive people. Reframe: judgment says more about judger than you, people who matter accept you, pleasing everyone impossible and exhausting. Therapy especially helpful (CBT addresses core beliefs).

      "question": "How do I deal with change?",
      "answer": "Change - whether positive or negative, chosen or forced - disrupts routine and triggers stress. Adaptability crucial life skill. **Treatment & Solution:** Acknowledge emotions (grief, fear, excitement all valid - don't suppress), maintain what you can control (routines, relationships, self-care - provides stability amid change), give yourself adjustment time (expect discomfort - adaptation not instant), focus on opportunities not just losses (reframe when possible), take small steps (don't try adjusting everything immediately), seek support (talk to friends, family, therapist), practice self-compassion (change is hard - be patient with yourself), remember past resilience (you've handled changes before), maintain perspective (most changes less catastrophic than initially feel), stay flexible (rigid expectations increase suffering). Gradual change easier than sudden but both navigable. Change only constant - building adaptability serves you throughout life. What feels impossible today becomes normal tomorrow.",

      "answer": "Toe numbness indicates poor circulation, tight shoes, nerve compression (back or foot), diabetes (peripheral neuropathy), Morton's neuroma, or vitamin deficiency. **Treatment & Solution:** Wear proper fitting shoes (most common cause - tight toe box!), avoid high heels, warm feet gradually if cold, exercise regularly (improves circulation), check for diabetes (blood sugar control prevents worsening neuropathy), ensure adequate vitamin B12. For nerve compression from back: physical therapy, posture improvement. For Morton's neuroma: wider shoes, metatarsal pads, injections if severe. If numbness persistent, progressive, or accompanied by weakness, see doctor (nerve studies, imaging may be needed). Inspect feet daily (can't rely on feeling if numb - diabetes patients especially). Proper footwear prevents many cases. Numbness indicates potential nerve damage - address promptly to prevent worsening.",

      "question": "Why do I feel shaky inside?",
      "answer": "Internal tremor sensation (vibrating feeling inside body without visible shaking) indicates anxiety, stress, low blood sugar, caffeine, medication side effects, or neurological conditions. **Treatment & Solution:** For anxiety-related: practice calm breathing, grounding techniques, therapy, stress management, regular exercise, adequate sleep, limit caffeine. For low blood sugar: eat regular balanced meals, avoid skipping meals, include protein and complex carbs. Review medications with doctor (many cause tremor-like sensations). Stay hydrated. If accompanied by other neurological symptoms (weakness, coordination problems, vision changes), see doctor for evaluation. Internal tremor very common with anxiety - disconcerting but not dangerous.

      "answer": "Future anxiety (anticipatory anxiety) - worrying about what might happen - causes present suffering over imagined future pain. Common but manageable. **Treatment & Solution:** Practice present-moment awareness: mindfulness brings attention to now not future, grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1), notice when mind time-travels to future and gently return to present. Challenge thoughts: what evidence for feared future? How often do catastrophic predictions materialize? (Rarely!), distinguish possible from probable. Take action on controllables: prepare reasonably for future without obsessing, focus energy on today's responsibilities and joys. Accept uncertainty: discomfort with uncertainty drives future worry - practice tolerating not knowing, recognize no amount of worry prevents future events. Build resilience: confidence in ability to handle whatever comes more useful than predicting everything. Remember: you've handled every difficult day so far - trust you'll handle future ones too.

Cannot change past but can change relationship with it. **Treatment & Solution:** Acknowledge and learn: what lesson does mistake teach? How will you handle differently next time? Then consciously move on. Make amends if possible and appropriate (apologize, correct situation) - action resolves rumination better than thinking. Practice self-compassion: everyone makes mistakes - you're human not perfect, talk to yourself like you would friend. Challenge thoughts: is dwelling helpful or just punishing? Mistakes don't define you - one chapter not whole story. Redirect attention: when catch yourself ruminating, deliberately shift focus to present task or activity, thought-stopping ('stop!' then distract). Therapy especially helpful for persistent rumination - CBT specifically targets thought patterns. Remember: spending today punishing yourself for yesterday's mistakes robs you of today.

Often rooted in childhood experiences or low self-worth. **Treatment & Solution:** Build internal validation: acknowledge own accomplishments (don't wait for others), trust own judgment, practice self-affirmation, celebrate small wins privately. Identify why seeking: what need driving it? (Belonging, worth, safety?), address root cause through therapy if deep-seated. Practice: make decisions without consulting everyone, sit with discomfort when not praised, notice you're okay without constant feedback. Challenge thoughts: do you actually need approval or just want it? Can you handle someone not liking you? (Usually yes). Set boundaries: don't share everything seeking feedback, limit asking 'was that okay?' Build skills/competence (confidence reduces need for validation). Remember: others' opinions don't define your worth. Seeking some validation normal - excessive dependence problematic. You know yourself best.",

      "question": "What causes pain in outer elbow?",
      "answer": "Outer elbow pain (lateral epicondylitis - tennis elbow) indicates tendon inflammation from repetitive wrist/arm movements, gripping activities, or sports. Common in ages 30-50. **Treatment & Solution:** Rest from aggravating activities (complete rest initially, gradual return), ice 15-20 minutes multiple times daily, counterforce brace (below elbow reduces tendon stress), anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy essential (specific exercises strengthen and stretch). Exercises: wrist extensions, forearm stretches, grip strengthening (start light, progress gradually). Modify activities: proper technique in sports/work, ergonomic tools, avoid prolonged gripping. For persistent cases: corticosteroid or PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injections. Surgery rarely needed. Most cases improve in 6-12 months with conservative treatment. Patience crucial - rushing return to activity causes recurrence. Prevention: proper warm-up, gradual training increases, equipment modifications (larger racket grip), strengthen forearms before problem starts.",

      "answer": "Feeling hot without elevated temperature indicates menopause/perimenopause (hot flashes), anxiety, hyperthyroidism, medication side effects, food triggers (spicy food, alcohol), or overheating environment. **Treatment & Solution:** For hot flashes: dress in layers, cool environment, avoid triggers (spicy food, caffeine, alcohol, hot beverages, stress), regular exercise, maintain healthy weight, hormone replacement therapy or alternatives if severe. For anxiety: recognize body's stress response, calm breathing, address underlying anxiety. For hyperthyroidism: blood tests check thyroid, medication regulates hormones. For medications: discuss alternatives with doctor. General: stay hydrated, use fan, cool showers, breathable clothing. Track patterns (identify triggers - time of day, foods, activities). If accompanied by weight loss, rapid heartbeat, or tremor, check thyroid. Most isolated feeling of warmth without actual fever not concerning. Actual fever (>100.4°F/38°C) indicates infection or illness.",

      "answer": "Finger joint pain indicates arthritis (osteoarthritis or rheumatoid), trigger finger, gout, injury, or tenosynovitis. Pattern and joints affected guide diagnosis. **Treatment & Solution:** For osteoarthritis: anti-inflammatory medications, maintain joint mobility (gentle exercises), heat therapy, adaptive devices (jar openers, large-grip tools), joint protection techniques, injections if severe. For rheumatoid arthritis: disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs), treat inflammation aggressively to prevent joint damage. For trigger finger: splinting, stretching exercises, avoid repetitive gripping, corticosteroid injection very effective, surgery if needed. For gout: dietary changes (reduce purines - red meat, seafood, alcohol), medications (colchicine, allopurinol), stay hydrated. General: maintain healthy weight, hand exercises daily, avoid repetitive gripping, use larger grips on tools. Morning stiffness in multiple joints warrants evaluation.

      "answer": "Mental toughness (resilience, perseverance through adversity, emotional control under pressure) - developed skill, not fixed trait. Crucial for achievement and wellbeing. **Treatment & Solution:** Challenge yourself: step outside comfort zone regularly (builds confidence you can handle difficulty), set stretch goals, embrace discomfort deliberately. Reframe adversity: view obstacles as growth opportunities not threats, focus on what you can control, ask 'what can I learn?' Practice delayed gratification: resist immediate pleasure for long-term goals (builds discipline), do hard things when don't feel like it. Mental practices: visualization of success, positive self-talk (encouraging not critical), meditation (builds emotional regulation), focus on process not just outcomes. Physical: regular challenging exercise (translates to mental resilience), maintain sleep and nutrition (physical foundation for mental strength). Develop growth mindset: believe abilities improvable through effort, view failure as feedback. Remember: mental toughness doesn't mean suppressing emotions - means managing them effectively while persisting toward goals.",

      "question": "Why does anxiety cause chest tightness?",
      "answer": "Anxiety chest tightness results from muscle tension (chest wall muscles contract during stress), hyperventilation (rapid breathing changes blood chemistry causing chest sensation), and heightened awareness of normal heart sensations during anxiety. **Treatment & Solution:** During episode: practice slow controlled breathing (in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6 - counters hyperventilation), remind yourself it's anxiety not heart attack (though scary, not dangerous), loosen tight clothing, change position, progressive muscle relaxation (tense then release chest and shoulder muscles), grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1), distraction. Long-term: treat underlying anxiety (therapy especially CBT very effective for physical anxiety symptoms), daily breathing exercises (builds skill for episodes), regular aerobic exercise (reduces baseline anxiety and improves breathing efficiency), yoga or tai chi (combines movement, breathing, mindfulness). Learn to distinguish anxiety from cardiac chest pain: anxiety doesn't worsen with exertion, often accompanies worry/stress, improves with calming techniques.

Common in runners and athletes. **Treatment & Solution:** For shin splints: rest from high-impact activities (substitute swimming, cycling), ice after activity, anti-inflammatory medications, gradual return with proper progression, stretch and strengthen calves and anterior tibialis, proper running shoes (replace every 300-500 miles), avoid hard surfaces. For stress fracture: rest crucial (continued activity worsens - may need boot), usually requires 6-8 weeks healing. For compartment syndrome: rest, elevation, sometimes surgery if chronic. Prevention: increase training gradually (10% rule), proper footwear, strengthen lower legs, avoid sudden terrain changes, cross-train. If severe pain, unable to bear weight, or not improving with rest, see doctor (X-ray or MRI may be needed). Most shin splints resolve with rest and gradual return.",

      "answer": "High sensitivity (easily hurt, overwhelmed by emotions, taking things personally) - partly temperament, partly learned, manageable with skills. Not weakness - sensitive people often empathetic and perceptive. **Treatment & Solution:** Build emotional resilience: practice perspective-taking (not everything about you), challenge thoughts ('did they mean to hurt me?' often not personal), develop thicker skin for unimportant opinions (save sensitivity for people who matter). Set boundaries: protect yourself from toxic people or situations, limit exposure to overwhelming stimuli when needed. Self-care crucial: adequate rest (fatigue increases sensitivity), stress management, regular exercise, healthy diet. Process emotions: journal, talk to trusted person, therapy - don't suppress but don't ruminate either. Distinguish sensitivity types: emotional reactivity vs empathy vs sensory sensitivity - strategies differ. Remember: goal not eliminate sensitivity (would lose valuable trait) but manage so doesn't control you. Selective sensitivity - care about feedback from important sources, dismiss rest.",

      "answer": "Morning anxiety (waking feeling anxious or having panic attack upon waking) results from cortisol spike (stress hormone naturally peaks morning), low blood sugar overnight, anticipatory anxiety about day, or withdrawal from evening substances. **Treatment & Solution:** Evening preparation: avoid alcohol before bed (causes rebound anxiety), limit evening caffeine, avoid heavy meals, don't watch stressful news, write worries before bed (externalizes), prepare for morning (reduces rush). Morning routine: don't check phone/email immediately, eat protein breakfast (stabilizes blood sugar), morning exercise even 10-minute walk (burns anxiety hormones), shower or splash cold water (shifts physiology), practice grounding or meditation, delay caffeine until after breakfast. Long-term: treat underlying anxiety disorder (therapy, medication if needed), improve sleep quality, address daytime stressors.

Environmental: minimize distractions (phone away, notifications off, quiet space), single-task not multitask, take regular breaks (brain needs rest), limit information consumption. Techniques: Pomodoro method (25 minutes focused work, 5 minute break), time-blocking, prioritize tasks (most important when energy highest), write things down (reduces mental load). For anxiety/depression: treat underlying condition (often resolves concentration problems). For ADHD: evaluation and treatment (medication, therapy, coaching).

      "answer": "Need for control (trying to control outcomes, others, situations) stems from anxiety about uncertainty - creates stress, relationship problems, exhaustion when inevitably cannot control everything. **Treatment & Solution:** Identify what you actually control: your actions, responses, effort, choices - NOT outcomes, others' behavior, circumstances, past, future. Practice surrender: start small (let others choose restaurant, don't micromanage project), notice discomfort without acting on it, trust process without controlling every step. Challenge beliefs: does control actually prevent bad outcomes? (Often creates worse outcomes through rigidity and stress). Focus on influence not control: can influence situations through actions but cannot guarantee specific outcomes. Build tolerance for uncertainty: practice 'not knowing' in low-stakes situations, recognize life always uncertain regardless of control attempts. Address underlying anxiety: therapy helps identify why need control (past trauma, perfectionism, lack of trust).

Pattern specific to ulnar nerve. **Treatment & Solution:** For cubital tunnel: avoid leaning on elbow, keep elbow straight (wear splint at night prevents bending), pad elbow if leaning necessary, ergonomic modifications, nerve gliding exercises, take breaks from repetitive activities. For Guyon's canal: avoid wrist flexion and pressure on wrist base, ergonomic handlebars (cyclists), padding. Physical therapy teaches nerve protection. Most cases improve with conservative treatment. Surgery if severe or progressive weakness. Cannot ignore persistent numbness - nerve damage worsens without treatment. Avoid activities compressing nerve.

Walk, hug, breathe, heal), appreciate specific features without conditions, speak to body kindly. Challenge thoughts: question beauty standards (arbitrary, change over time, culturally constructed), recognize edited/filtered images not reality, identify whose approval you're seeking and why it matters. Behavioral: stop body checking (mirrors, measuring, comparing), avoid triggering social media, wear comfortable clothes (not 'when I lose weight'), engage in joyful movement not punishment exercise. Curate environment: unfollow accounts causing comparison, surround yourself with body-diverse representations, limit weight/diet talk. Therapy if deeply rooted issues (trauma, eating disorder).
